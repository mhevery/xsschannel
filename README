============

XssChannel is a library which allows you to securely communicate 
between iframes from different domains. The library uses HTML5 
postMessage if available or gracefully down-grades to cross site 
communication with iframe URL hashes (breaking large requests into 
parts) as described here:

=========
= USAGE =
=========

There are two parts in order to establish communication between two
pages (which may be on two different domains): Container page, and
Remote Page.


Container Page:
---------------
// Create a communication channel
var send = xsschannel.connect("remotePageUrl", function(msg){
  alert(msg);
});
// Add the remote iframe to the DOM tree
document.body.appendChild(send.iframe);

// Send a message to the remote page
send("hello");

To establish communication with a remote page use the connect()
function. This will create a send method and an iframe. The
iframe needs to be added to the page DOM before the communication
channel can be used.

To send a message simply call the send function().


Remote Page:
------------
// Listen on remote requests
var send = xsschannel.listen(function(msg){
  alert(msg);
});

// send a message to a container page
send("greetings");

The remote page needs to expose itself for XSS communication with
the listen method.
